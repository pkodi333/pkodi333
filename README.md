# 👋 Hey there, I'm Prashanti!

I'm a curious, people-first data analyst who loves translating complex data into simple, actionable insights that drive real business impact. With 4+ years of experience and a Master’s in Business Analytics from UT Austin, I’ve worked across customer experience, marketing funnels, and product growth—always with a lens on user behavior and retention.

Whether I’m deep in SQL optimizing a data pipeline, using Python to segment users, or building clean and insightful dashboards in Power BI, Tableau or Looker, I’m always chasing one goal: **helping teams make smarter decisions, faster.**

## 🧰 What I Bring to the Table

- 📊 **Analytics That Drive Action**  
  I don’t just crunch numbers—I dig into the “why,” connect the dots, and surface the *so what* for stakeholders.
  
- ⚙️ **Tools I Love**  
  SQL | Python (pandas, seaborn) | R | Excel | Power BI | Tableau | Looker | Databricks | Snowflake | Qualtrics | dbt

- 🔁 **Experiments & Optimization**  
  A/B testing, regression modeling, funnel conversion analysis, and customer segmentation

- 🤝 **Cross-functional Communication**  
  I’ve partnered with product managers, marketers, and engineers to turn messy questions into clear, data-backed decisions.
